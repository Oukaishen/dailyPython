# String

For string substitution, Python recommend to use **Format** method, instead the old %-formatting.

Comparison between these two ways can be found in this [question in Stackflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5082452/python-string-formatting-vs-format).

Details of the **format** method can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html).

Details of old **%-formatting** may be found [here](http://www.runoob.com/python3/python3-string.html).
